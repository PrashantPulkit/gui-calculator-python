# gui-calculator-python
This mini-project is a basic graphical user interface (GUI) calculator built using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

It was made a couple of months before the creation of this repository ago as one of my first Python projects. It was mainly for my own practice and learning, especially to get hands-on with Tkinter.
